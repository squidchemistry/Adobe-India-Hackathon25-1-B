Di\ufb00erent types of sources have di\ufb00erent tools available for PDF \nconversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in \nthe Print dialog box. \nIf a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft \nExcel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is \nalready open, you don\u2019t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. \nEvery PDF balances e\ufb03ciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the \nbalance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an \nappropriate conversion method. \nFor example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat \napplies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. \nIf you want more control over the process, you\u2019ll want to use another method. \nPDF creation methods by file type \nRefer to the following lists to determine the methods available for the di\ufb00erent types of files. \nFile Type \nPDF Creation Methods \nAny file format \nMethod 1: From the top tools bar, select Create. Then, select a \nfile type and then select the file that you want to convert to \nPDF. \nOr, select the hamburger menu \n (Windows) or \nthe File menu (macOS)  > Create and then select the \nappropriate file type and follow through the steps.  \nMethod 2: Drag and drop a file from your system to the \nAcrobat Home page. \nMethod 3: Right-click on the file and then select Convert to \nAdobe PDF.",

Acrobat's \nimage-editing capabilities are limited, and using high-resolution images can lead to \nperformance issues due to larger file sizes. To address this, improve images using other tools \nbefore adding them to PDF documents. \nIf the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance. \nTo maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed \nthem within the PDF. \nYou can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding \nalternative text for images and proper content tagging. \nRefer to the following topics to learn how to add, resize, move, or replace images and objects \nin a PDF using Acrobat. \n \nAdd images in a PDF \n1. Open the PDF in Acrobat. Select Edit a PDF from the All tools menu and then \nselect Image. \n2. From the drop-down menu, select Choose image to select an image from your device \nor Select Generate image to generate an image from text. \n \nNote:  \nTo learn how to generate images from text, go to Generate unique AI images from text.",

        "chunk_text": "Edit Scanned PDFs \nEditing a scanned PDF can be complicated if it includes low-quality text or images, non-\neditable text, line breaks, or complex formatting. Other inhibiting factors include compatibility \nissues, security restrictions, and large file sizes, which are more prevalent in PDFs created from \nscanned images. \nTo streamline the process, consider the following best practices and guidelines before editing \na scanned document: \nCheck the accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) output. When you open a \nscanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR in the background to make the \ndocument editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is \naccurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the Scan & OCR > Recognize \nText tool to improve the output. \nEnhance image quality. If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the Enhance \nscanned file or Enhance camera image feature to improve the quality of images before \nattempting to edit the document. For more information, see Scan documents to PDF. \nUse the correct font and formatting. When editing the document, ensure that the font and \nformatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't \nhave the desired fonts on your computer, see Add fonts to your computer. \nRemove security restrictions. If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing, \nremove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove \nsecurity from a PDF, see Unlock a PDF. \nAvoid editing complex elements. If the scanned PDF contains tables, graphs, or images, \navoid unnecessary edits that could alter the layout or formatting of these elements. \nCheck for compatibility issues. Ensure that the version of Adobe Acrobat you're using is \ncompatible with the scanned PDF. If you encounter compatibility issues, try updating Adobe \nAcrobat. For more information, see System requirements. \nSave a backup copy. Always save a backup copy of the original scanned PDF before making \nany edits. Revert to the original document if any issues arise during the editing process. \nRecognize text on scanned PDF \nYou can use the Scan & OCR tool to recognize text, change OCR language, and make all \npages editable in one go.

The original \nfile is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the \nchanges you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new \ninformation that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the \nautosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes \nof your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is \nespecially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. \nYou can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you \nclose, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted. \nNote:  \nIf you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave \nfeature so that you don\u2019t lose your place when the file is reloaded. \nThe Autosave feature won\u2019t work in the following cases: \n\u2022 \nA document that has its security changed.

We currently \nhave integrated the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service with our proprietary technologies to \nprovide generative AI capability in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader. \nDoes adobe concurrently train any large language models (\u201cLLMS\u201d) with your content \nwhile you're using generative ai features in acrobat? \nNo. Acrobat does not train any LLMs on your content concurrent to your interactions with \ngenerative AI in Acrobat. Prompts provided to AI Assistant do not modify the underlying \nmodel. Your content will not be used to train any LLMs that deliver Acrobat\u2019s generative AI \ncapability. For more information, please refer to the questions above in this help section \n(Content Usage and Handling Practices). \n \nNote:  \nAdobe does not use content from an organization or school account for product \nimprovement for generative AI unless otherwise agreed to by the organization or school. \n \nManaging chat history \nWhat is chat history? \nAcrobat now allows you to reference past conversations you had with AI Assistant. Chat \nhistory includes your textual prompts and generated responses for a specific document or a \nset of documents you selected, also termed a Collection. \nHow can I see my chat history? \nChat history includes your past conversations with AI Assistant and is linked to either a single \ndocument or a Collection. To view these conversations, simply open the document or \nCollection from your list of recent files.",

Instead, you can copy the chat history or specific generated \nresponses into your text editor of choice. Learn more here.   \nHow can I clear my chat history in AI Assistant? \nYou can clear chat history from the More menu for each individual document or a Collection. \nSelecting Clear chat history will delete all of the chat history, meaning the document \noverview, textual prompts (suggested by AI Assistant or provided by you), and generated \nresponses. \nCan I disable chat history in AI Assistant? \nThis is currently not available to users.  \nCan i share my chat history with others? \nNo, you can\u2019t share your chat history with other users. \nWhat happens if I disconnect acrobat from other third-party cloud storage services such as \ngoogle drive or OneDrive? \nYou'll no longer be able to access your third-party cloud storage files in Acrobat and the AI \nAssistant chats associated with them.",
